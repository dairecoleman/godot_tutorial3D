	Setting Up game Area
	1. Main node
	2. Static body node (ground)
		a. Collision 3d body w shape Boxshape3D
		b. Give its dimensions
	3. Collision body is see through need to modify 'ground' node
		a. >Meshinstance>BoxMesh= visible box

	4. Grid Snapping - lower ground to see mesh
	5. Directional light node, rotate to light

	Player Scene, Input Actions, Movement
	1. NewScene>PlayerCharacter>Name>Node3D>drag .glb file on
	2. CollisionShape3d + SphereShape3d (As with all kinds of physics nodes, we need a collision shape for our character to collide with) 
	3. Size and position

	Input Actions
	1. Input Map , Project>Project Settings>Input Map> add actions + Map buttons

	Moving the player with Code
	1. Attach script to player node
		extends CharacterBody3D
		
		# How fast the player moves in meters per second.
		@export var speed = 14
		# The downward acceleration when in the air, in meters per second squared.
		@export var fall_acceleration = 75
		
		var target_velocity = Vector3.ZERO
		
		
		func _physics_process(delta):
			var direction = Vector3.ZERO
		
			if Input.is_action_pressed("move_right"):
				direction.x += 1
			if Input.is_action_pressed("move_left"):
				direction.x -= 1
			if Input.is_action_pressed("move_back"):
				direction.z += 1
			if Input.is_action_pressed("move_forward"):
				direction.z -= 1
		
			if direction != Vector3.ZERO:
				direction = direction.normalized()
				$Pivot.basis = Basis.looking_at(direction)
		
			# Ground Velocity
			target_velocity.x = direction.x * speed
			target_velocity.z = direction.z * speed
		
			# Vertical Velocity
			if not is_on_floor(): # If in the air, fall towards the floor. Literally gravity
				target_velocity.y = target_velocity.y - (fall_acceleration * delta)
		
			# Moving the Character
			velocity = target_velocity
			move_and_slide()
		2. Instantiate and add camera, need camera for 3d
			i. Marker3D, Camera3D move and rotate, perspective setting

		Adding mob
	1. VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D - node that deletes off screen objects
	Add a child node Path3D, cyclinders, close path
	PathFollow3D
	
	Add mob.tscn to main:
	Export variable in main.gd
	
	@export var mob_scene: PackedScene
	Drag mob.tscn to property on inspector tab
	
Timer, Use signals to randomly initialize monsters
